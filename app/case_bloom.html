           Stable version in 2 months
          </span>
          We have rapidly progressed from a substantial technical debt and a non-functioning data structure to&nbsp;the&nbsp;stable product version. Backend issues have been resolved, UX/UI reworked, database optimized. the&nbsp;product has entered the&nbsp;exploitation stage on time

            Twice more active users

          In comparison with the&nbsp;previous launch attempt BLOOM has gained 50% active users during the&nbsp;test period
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            30% faster staff assessment
          </span>
          Major companies that started to&nbsp;use BLOOM have reported: centralized and automated assessment takes a third less time than manual and in-person
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Increased worker loyalty
          </span>
          A company which uses BLOOM has noticed that the&nbsp;system provides more independent and unbiased staff assessment results, which increases trust towards the&nbsp;employer

            International market and no more language barrier

          Initially BLOOM was available only in Dutch, which narrowed the&nbsp;potential customer base. ITP has developed and released an English version. Currently BLOOM is successfully conquering the&nbsp;international market and recently a major worldwide corporation has become its registered user

      <ul class="case-item-list">
        <li>
          The&nbsp;previous version of the&nbsp;system was not documented. Our team had to&nbsp;explore the&nbsp;database architecture on the&nbsp;go and integrate existing concepts into&nbsp;the&nbsp;new data structure
        </li>
        <li>
          The&nbsp;initial brief and technical requirements that we received from the&nbsp;client did not cover the&nbsp;full functionality of the&nbsp;product. We had to&nbsp;plan the&nbsp;development process flexibly, regularly collaborating with the&nbsp;client to&nbsp;prioritize and schedule the&nbsp;tasks
        </li>
        <li>
          Some critical issues raised during deployment. the&nbsp;client hosted and ran the&nbsp;application on his own server, and transferring it to&nbsp;a dedicated Ubuntu machine resulted in severe errors, which were considered the&nbsp;fault of our developers
        </li>
        <li>
          After we received access to&nbsp;the&nbsp;dev-machine it became clear that the&nbsp;issues were caused by the&nbsp;legacy backend code and architecture. We fixed them and proved the&nbsp;importance of refactoring to&nbsp;the&nbsp;client
        </li>
        <li>
          There was no project manager from the&nbsp;client’s side, therefore the&nbsp;workflow didn’t run smoothly. We helped to&nbsp;set up effective task management in Jira and it solved the&nbsp;issue
        </li>
        <li>
          The&nbsp;legacy version of BLOOM was available only in Dutch, so ITP team had to&nbsp;learn the&nbsp;basics of the&nbsp;language to&nbsp;understand how the&nbsp;system functioned
